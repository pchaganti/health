## Installation

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/krumjahn/applehealth/main/install.sh | bash
```

Or install directly with pipx:

```bash
pipx install healthai
```

Then run:

```bash
healthai
```

On first launch, a setup wizard walks you through choosing your AI model (GPT-4o, Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek-R1, and 50+ more), setting your API key, and pointing to your `export.xml`. Re-run it any time with `healthai --setup`. The saved export path is reused by slash commands and chat.

### 🚀 **Prefer a GUI?**
Visit **[applehealthdata.com](https://applehealthdata.com)** for instant, interactive analysis without the terminal.

## 🧐 What is this?

A purpose-built CLI that turns your Apple Health `export.xml` into a conversational AI session. Think of it as having a personal health analyst in your terminal — one that knows your exact data and can answer questions, spot trends, and generate charts without sending anything to a third party unless you choose to.

It's built for developers, biohackers, and researchers who want **full control** over their health data pipeline.

## ✨ Key Features
- 💬 **Chat REPL**: Ask questions in plain English. `"What were my most active months last year?"` — chat builds query-aware local summaries and includes recent complete rows.
- 🧠 **50+ AI Models**: GPT-4o, Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek-R1, Grok, Mistral, Llama, and any Ollama local model.
- 🔒 **100% Private Mode**: Run DeepSeek-R1 or Llama 3 locally via Ollama — no data leaves your machine.
- 📊 **Automated Charts**: Daily heart-rate means, source-reconciled sleep patterns, and workout heart-rate intensity.
- 📤 **High-Fidelity Export**: XML → CSV/JSON preserving all metadata (Record, Workout, ActivitySummary).
- 💍 **Smart Ring Integration**: Unified view of **Oura**, **Whoop**, and **Samsung Ring** data via Apple Health sync.
- 🔄 **WHOOP Integration**: Specialized support for augmenting Apple Health data with WHOOP metrics.

## 💬 Chat with Your Health Data

After setup, `healthai` drops you into a chat interface. Just type naturally:

```
  🫀 healthai  v1.5.0
  AI      → OpenAI (ChatGPT)
  Outputs → ~/healthai_output

  › What were my most active weeks last year?
  › How does my sleep correlate with my workout intensity?
  › Show me my heart rate trends over the past 3 months
```

Slash commands handle data operations:

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/diagnose` | Audit metric calculations, units, sources, skipped records, and export types |
| `/steps` | Analyze step count trends |
| `/heartrate` | Daily average heart-rate trends |
| `/sleep` | Source-reconciled sleep duration and stage patterns |
| `/workouts` | Workout history with normalized distance, energy, and available heart-rate intensity |
| `/weight` | Body-mass trends normalized to kilograms |
| `/csv` | Export raw records plus processed metric CSVs used by chat |
| `/json` | Export all metrics to JSON |
| `/settings` | Change AI model, per-metric source priority, and maximum heart rate |
| `/setup` | Re-run the setup wizard |
| `/help` | Show all available commands |
| `/exit` | Quit |

## 🛠️ "Steal My System": From 8 Years of Data to Actionable Training
I used this exact tool to analyze 8 years of my own fitness history. Here's the system:
1. **The Pattern**: I discovered that my most active days (40k+ steps) almost never coincided with gym sessions—they were work-related.
2. **The Optimization**: I used the AI Analyzer to identify "Heart Rate Cycles" (3-4 week recovery dips) to automate my deload weeks.
3. **The Result**: A training plan that finally matches my biology instead of a generic app's schedule.

## ⚡ Quick Start

**Recommended (install once, run anywhere):**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/krumjahn/applehealth/main/install.sh | bash
healthai
```

### Calculation policy

Apple Health exports can contain overlapping measurements from an iPhone, Apple Watch, and third-party devices. `healthai` now reconciles overlapping cumulative intervals instead of blindly adding every source. Its automatic order prefers manually entered Health data, then Apple Watch, then iPhone/iPad, then third-party sources. Because `export.xml` does not include the source order configured in the Health app, use `/settings` to set the exact priority for each metric when your preferred tracker differs.

All supported units are normalized before aggregation: distance to kilometers, body mass to kilograms, energy to kilocalories, and heart rate to BPM. Unsupported units are skipped and listed by `/diagnose`; they are never silently mislabeled.

**Imperial units (miles / pounds):** open `/settings` → *Choose units* and pick `imperial`. Charts, summaries, exported CSVs, and AI analyses then use miles and pounds instead of km and kg. You can also set `APPLEHEALTH_UNITS=imperial` in the environment.

**Source filter (e.g. only Apple Watch):** if a third-party app (Argus, Fitbit, etc.) pollutes your metrics, open `/settings` → *Configure data sources* and enter the sources to include — everything else is ignored entirely, no editing of `export.xml` required. Non-interactive equivalent: `APPLEHEALTH_SOURCES="Keith's Apple Watch"` (comma-separate multiple sources; names must match the sources listed in the settings screen).

**Or clone and run directly:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/krumjahn/applehealth.git && cd applehealth
./run
```

**For private local AI (DeepSeek-R1, free, no API key):**
1. Install [Ollama](https://ollama.ai) and run `ollama pull deepseek-r1`.
2. Launch `healthai`, choose **Ollama** in the setup wizard.

## 🖥️ Local LLM Setup

Run any model 100% on your own machine — no API key, no data leaving your device.

### Ollama (easiest)

```bash
# 1. Install Ollama: https://ollama.ai
# 2. Pull a model
ollama pull llama3.1          # Meta Llama 3.1 8B
ollama pull deepseek-r1       # DeepSeek R1 reasoning
ollama pull mistral           # Mistral 7B
ollama pull qwen3             # Qwen3

# 3. Run healthai and pick Ollama from the Featured section
healthai --setup
```

Ollama runs on `localhost:11434` automatically. No configuration needed.

### Jan

[Jan](https://jan.ai) is a desktop app with a built-in model library and local API server.

```
1. Download Jan from https://jan.ai
2. Install a model inside the Jan app (e.g. Llama 3.1 8B)
3. Enable the API server: Settings → Local API Server → Start
4. Run: healthai --setup
5. Choose "Jan — local server (localhost:1337)"
6. Enter the model name shown in Jan (e.g. llama3.1-8b-instruct)
```

### LM Studio

[LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai) lets you download and run GGUF models with a GUI.

```
1. Download LM Studio from https://lmstudio.ai
2. Download a model from the Discover tab
3. Go to Local Server tab → Start Server
4. Run: healthai --setup
5. Choose "LM Studio (localhost:1234)"
6. Enter the model name shown in LM Studio's server tab
```

### llama.cpp

For advanced users running [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) server mode:

```bash
# Start llama.cpp in server mode
./llama-server -m your-model.gguf --port 8080

# Then in healthai --setup, choose "llama.cpp server (localhost:8080)"
# Enter the model name (usually the filename without .gguf)
```

### GPT4All

[GPT4All](https://gpt4all.io) has an optional local API server:

```
1. Open GPT4All → Settings → Application → Advanced
2. Enable "Local API Server" on port 4891
3. Run: healthai --setup → choose "GPT4All (localhost:4891)"
```

### Any OpenAI-compatible server

vLLM, LocalAI, Llamafile, and any other server that exposes an OpenAI-compatible `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint works via **"Custom OpenAI-compatible endpoint"** in the setup wizard.

## 🦞 OpenClaw Support

This repo now has a published OpenClaw skill:

**[Install from ClawHub: Apple Health Export Analyzer](https://clawhub.ai/krumjahn/apple-health-export-analyzer)**

What OpenClaw does for normal users:
- check your Apple Health data quickly
- turn it into a short daily health brief
- give you simple daily tips on how to improve

The skill now supports two sources:
- the `Health Data AI Analyzer` Mac app if its local API is available
- this open-source `applehealth` export.xml workflow as a fallback

For the Mac app path, the public skill now uses read-only localhost OpenClaw endpoints and does not need to read a local token file.

If you want to use the Mac app path in a restricted OpenClaw session, run the one-time companion installer:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/krumjahn/applehealth.git
cd applehealth
python skills/apple-health-export-analyzer/scripts/install_mac_app_companion.py --restart
```

Then use the companion skill:

```text
Use the health-analyzer-mac-local skill. Give me my daily health brief for today and 3 suggestions.
```

Use it if you want OpenClaw to:
- verify your Apple Health export setup
- generate a daily health brief from `export.xml`
- compare your steps and sleep over the last 7 days
- create a weekly summary with workouts and heart rate context
- help you set up a recurring daily health message

Example output:

```text
Status
- Today was a low-activity day relative to your recent baseline.

What changed
- Steps: 2,431 vs 7-day baseline 9,993
- Workouts: 0 minutes, 0 workouts
- Sleep: insufficient data

Suggestions
1. Add one easy walk today instead of trying to catch up with a hard workout.
2. Use one fixed movement anchor, like a walk after lunch.
3. Keep effort moderate when recovery data is missing.
```

Example prompts:

```text
Use the Apple Health Export Analyzer skill. Verify my setup and give me my latest daily health brief with 3 suggestions.

Use the Apple Health Export Analyzer skill. Compare my steps and sleep over the last 7 days.

Use the Apple Health Export Analyzer skill. Generate a weekly summary from my Apple Health export.
```

## 🤖 Instructions for AI Agents
*If you are an AI Agent (Claude Code, Windsurf, OpenClaw) helping a user analyze health data:*
1. Clone this repo into the user's workspace.
2. Direct the user to place their `export.xml` in the root.
3. Call `python src/applehealth.py --export ./export.xml --out ./analysis` to generate the CSV datasets.
4. Read the resulting `.csv` files to provide personalized medical/fitness coaching.

### 🦞 Local OpenClaw Workflow

```text
skills/apple-health-export-analyzer
```

The skill includes concrete scripts for:
- verifying the local repo and `export.xml` setup
- generating a daily Apple Health brief
- comparing recent step and sleep trends
- generating a weekly summary

Example:

```bash
python skills/apple-health-export-analyzer/scripts/check_setup.py --repo /path/to/applehealth --export /path/to/export.xml --out /path/to/analysis
python skills/apple-health-export-analyzer/scripts/daily_brief.py --repo /path/to/applehealth --export /path/to/export.xml --out /path/to/analysis
```
